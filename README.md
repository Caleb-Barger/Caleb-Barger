I love taking a creative approach to to solving problems, by contributing meaningfully to teams and striving to push beyond my comfort zone and take on challenges. I am looking for purpose and a mission that I can get onboard with by showing up and giving it my all. 

Recently I have been writing applications with React.js + Java as a full-stack engineer. ( see projects below for more info )... I really enjoy looking for new technologies to learn and roll into my existing development flow. 

As of right now I am extremely interested in distributed applications with Elixir, Rust's implementation of memory safety, and the stuff with concurrency that go is doing!

On the less technical end of things I love distance running, participating in marathons and other competitions. When I am not running or programming usually I can be found chatting with friends or playing games ( Spelunky 2 Just released :D FYI )
