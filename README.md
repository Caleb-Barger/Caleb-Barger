Currently pursing a rewarding, positive, and challenging career in software development. By taking a creative approach to to solving problems, contributing meaningfully to teams and striving to deliver a quality product makes me a valuable asset to your team!

Recently I have been writing applications with React.js + Java as a full-stack developer. ( see projects below for more info )... I really enjoy looking for new technologies to learn and roll into my existing development flow. 

As of right now I am extremely interested in distributed applications with Elixir, Rust's implementation of memory safety, and go's concurrency model. On the less technical end of things I am a distance runner.
